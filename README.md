# Star-Wars-RPG

Here's how the app works:

1. When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on the fighter's picture. The player will fight as that character for the rest of the game.

The player must then defeat all of the remaining fighters.

The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture.

Once the player selects an opponent, that enemy is moved to a fighter area.

The player will now be able to click the attack button.

Whenever the player clicks attack, their character damages the defender. The opponent will lose Health points. These points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture.
The opponent character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's character will lose some of their Health. These points are shown at the bottom of the player character's picture.

2. The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.

When the defender's Health is reduced to zero or below, the defeated enemy is removed from the fighter area and the player character can now choose a new opponent.

If the player's health is low, he or she may click Jump to Hyperspace instead of Attack. The move gives the player a 50/50 chance of escaping (resetting) the game with full Health points or instantly losing.

3. The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. The player loses the game the game if their character's Health falls to zero or below, or if the player's Jump to Hyperspace is unsuccessful.
